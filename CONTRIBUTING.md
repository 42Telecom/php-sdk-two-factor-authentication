# Guidelines

## Coding standards

When developing we try to follow the following standards:
* [PSR-2: Coding Style Guide](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)
* [PSR-4: Autoloader](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/)
* [PSR-5 for documentation](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/fig-standards/tree/master/proposed)

See the [PSR-FIG website](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/) for more information.

## Version number
The version numbers follow the [semantic version rules 2.0](http://semver.org/)

## Workflow

We follow the [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) as working model with git. And any modification have to go through a Pull Request.

# Report an issue or proposing modifications:

The github repository is the central repository for this project.
So you can report issues and create pull request directly on the github repository.
Don't hesitate to contact the support of the maintainer of the repository before.
